<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in EastNorthport NY</h3>
<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are many factors that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that accelerate corrosion Likewise, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of corrosion control. Hence, thinking about all these factors, in addition to results from research study studies, WQA's position is that a correctly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
