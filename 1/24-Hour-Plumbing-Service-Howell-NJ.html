<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>

When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. It can also trigger the system to leak if the bypass valve is broken. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed over time. A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regrowth processes. A used water valve can lock up and spring a leak. It is most likely split and just needs to be replaced if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
