<p>Lots of bad things are being stated on this short article about liners. I find that many old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no idea on what they are stating. Because they don't like the innovation and not since it doesn't work, will also state something does not work well simply. If this heater is set up in a house with multiple restrooms, the piping process adds to the installation costs.</p>
<p>Even if you believe you can manage it on your own, you probably don't have a camera suitable for identifying the cause of obstruction around bends in your pipes. You may even have a drain snake useful, but when's the last time you used it-- and are you sure you're doing it right?
