<p>Water softeners leaks are mainly triggered since of a concern at the point of installation or since of maintenance. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. It can also trigger the system to leak if the bypass valve is split. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced over time. A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regrowth processes. A used water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely cracked and just needs to be replaced.</p>
