<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual choice. A license is not needed for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided changes are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A common water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, wide brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a close-by drain or drywell.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as displayed in Image 1. If additional pressure on the flapper doesn't stop the running noise, water is most likely getting away through a cracked or rusted overflow tube. In that case, you have to separate the tank from the bowl and replace the whole flush valve. Considering that the overflow tube is seldom the cause of a running toilet, we won't cover that repair here.</p>
