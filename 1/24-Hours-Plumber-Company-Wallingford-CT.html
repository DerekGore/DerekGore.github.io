If things need to be customized, replaced, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and for that reason the total expenses. The majority of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with most disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor costs roughly $150.</p>

Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to get rid of.</p>
