<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Warminster PA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can cause leakages. As these leaks occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these problems.</p>
