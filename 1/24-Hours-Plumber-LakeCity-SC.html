<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were extensively utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and channels, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
<p>The system has returned to a zero need condition (no valves open downstream). Nevertheless, debris in between the # 1 Check Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the elements, is preventing the # 1 Examine from closing all the way.

When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
