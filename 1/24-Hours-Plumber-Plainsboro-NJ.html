<p>As explained earlier in the short article, carbon monoxide is colorless and entirely odorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every home should have carbon monoxide gas detectors set up at the correct areas. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single houses to have both smoke and carbon monoxide gas detectors. They are normally offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new setups should have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
<p>Drain pipe is not protected using the needed solvent cement (end of the pipe should be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not really glued in the regular sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is actually a solvent that melts the surfaces of the pipe and fitting for a couple of seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are split, punctured or collapsed by shifting soil, frozen ground, settling, and so on</p>
