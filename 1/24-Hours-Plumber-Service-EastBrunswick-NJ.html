<p>When you need a water heater replacement, there are a number of things that you should consider to assist you choose. A good basic guideline is that as soon as your present hot water heater reaches its 10th birthday, you must begin getting ready for a replacement. At this age, you will understand that it is nearing the end of its usefulness so this is a fun time to start taking a look at your replacement options.
