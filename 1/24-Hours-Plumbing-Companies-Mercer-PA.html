<p>Backpressure might happen when the safe and clean supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping.

If these connections are not appropriately protected, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be pushed into the safe and clean supply system.</p>

When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health threat if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for efficiency, in addition to checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
