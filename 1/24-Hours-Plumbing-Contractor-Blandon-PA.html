<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively used in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>

Broken Pipes: Pipes are broken, pierced or collapsed by moving soil, frozen ground, settling, and so on</p>
