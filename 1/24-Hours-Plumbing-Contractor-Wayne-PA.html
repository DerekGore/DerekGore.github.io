A garbage disposal generally plugs into a 120-volt GFCI (ground-fault circuit interruptor) outlet under the sink. If an outlet like this isn't offered under your sink, you'll need to have an electrical expert install one.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
