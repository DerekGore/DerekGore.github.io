<p>Softeners generally eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are often referred to as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they ought to be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a big red flag that something more severe is wrong with them.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is normal in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
