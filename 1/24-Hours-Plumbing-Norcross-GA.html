<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Norcross GA</h3>
<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts must be removed and changed with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is essential that just original factory repair parts are utilized. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was designed to use and changing the rubber from the initial factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>To identify if your home is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it goes into the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is attached to the end of the water main. Ensure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe enters the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
