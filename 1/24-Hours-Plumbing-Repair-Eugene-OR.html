Whenever you experience any kind of plumbing problem, the very first thing you need is a proper diagnosis of the problem. There can be many factors someone is experiencing problems with their drains or sewer lines, and only a professional can offer an appropriate diagnosis. We ask that you do not lose at any time trying to determine the factor behind your plumbing problems, as this can further postpone looking for the professional support you need.</p>

<p>Sinkholes do not just happen in your lawn, sadly, when a sewer line breaks. If there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running below your house's structure, the very best you can expect is to learn quickly. Otherwise, as the leaky sewer line spills out beneath your home, a sinkhole will trigger the foundation to shift and establish cracks. In this case, you'll need expert plumbers in addition to foundation repair experts.</p>
<p>Everyone who's set up a couple of disposals understands this mistake: Forgetting to remove the dishwasher knockout prior to hanging the unit. Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been just recently used and you've replaced the flapper, the issue might be bigger than it appears. The tank ultimately loses its capability to seal correctly, creating waste and a higher water bill.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 factor our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning specialists are called into a home is because there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are quite low-cost and simple to install, so there's no factor not to. Eventually triggering a backup when grease strengthens it sticks to the pipe and avoids water flow. This added with other particles in your drain can trigger a significant backup.</p>
