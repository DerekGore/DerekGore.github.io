<h3>What Kinds Of Tools Do Plumbers Use Williamsburg VA</h3>
<p>If these mixes aren't successful in unclogging your sink, reach for a typical household plunger. If you have a double sink, first seal the 2nd side with a wet fabric or a stopper. You'll need to develop a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you plan to plunge with sufficient water to cover the bell of the plunger. Place the plunger firmly over the drain and plunge vigorously a number of times. Remove the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water when you hear the suction clear the clog.</p>
