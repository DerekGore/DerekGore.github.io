<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is adversely charged and has space to hold on to positive ions. The fresh media begins by holding on to the weaker charged salt ions. As hard water goes through your water softener tank, the stronger charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet.

<p>Other pipe repair strategies include our Pipe Pull technique and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull method interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with new piping by the use of a tiny hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into place. All new replacement pipes have actually a projected life expectancy of one hundred years and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another reliable technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining essentially gets rid of the need for broken pipe removal.
