<p>A variety of organizations, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) offer certification courses created to train specialists to check backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to end up being certified.</p>
<p>When the data collected from the field test indicates the assembly has broken down in its efficiency listed below the developed minimum standard, backflow preventers ought to only be repaired. The test procedure is a diagnostic assessment of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer need to be fixed or if essential, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This suggests the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
