<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to prevent backflow. The fundamental means of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
