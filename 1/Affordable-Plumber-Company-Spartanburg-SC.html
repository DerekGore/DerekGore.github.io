<p>For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Since pressure is lost during these events, water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will flow backwards into the city water lines. Although an EcoWater dealer does not support your area presently, we enjoy to help you with an alternative solution.

<p>As discussed previously in the post, carbon monoxide gas is colorless and completely odor free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide gas detector. Every home should have carbon monoxide detectors set up at the correct locations. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single residences to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are generally sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new installations need to have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
<p>Discover if there are any lead pipes in the house. Residences that were developed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how beneficial, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have kids, you may not want to reside in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting simply wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a very costly alternative.</p>
