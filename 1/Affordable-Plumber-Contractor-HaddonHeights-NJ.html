<p>Say you choose to go that route. The next concern is whether you can install it yourself. Put it by doing this, if you're an experienced handy individual, however you have actually never ever managed this specific repair, you can most likely do it, providing you do your research. I would draw the line at attempting to install a power-vented gas-fired hot water heater (and some other customized designs). Their installation should be handled by a licensed mechanical or plumbing contractor.</p>
<p>Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline before the problem got worse. Waiting just wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a very pricey alternative.</p>
