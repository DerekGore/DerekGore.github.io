<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the required direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the polluted water to become a health hazard if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for effectiveness, in addition to examined every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
