<p>Whenever you flush your toilet, you'll discover that water runs to fill up the bowl. Nevertheless, in an appropriately working toilet, the water must stop running when the bowl is filled to its proper capacity. If your toilet continues to run, chances are you have an internal leak and water is being discarded down the overflow. These leaks are exceptionally inefficient, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up taking a trip through the overflow.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the cause of the issue. The line was clearly degrading; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
