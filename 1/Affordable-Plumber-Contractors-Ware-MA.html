<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
