<p>Plumbing is the practice, products and fixtures utilized in the installation, maintenance, extension, and change of all piping, fixtures, plumbing devices, and plumbing appurtenances in connection with hygienic drainage or storm drainage facilities; venting systems and private or public supply of water systems, within or nearby to any building or structure.</p>
<p>It may be time to get it changed if your water heater has required several repairs over the last few years. A great rule of thumb for hot water heater is this: due to the fact that the lifespan of the average water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point.

<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent dual flush HET offered by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.
