"Restoring" refers to the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "exhausted" or complete. However, many water softeners regenerate frequently, when the filter medium really isn't complete. This can be remedied by just resetting your water softener to get rid of less firmness or to run longer in between regeneration cycles.</p>

<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
