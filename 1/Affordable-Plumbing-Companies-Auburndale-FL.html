<p>2 designs of PVBs are readily available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. A PVB might be used to isolate health or non-health dangers but is effective against back-siphonage just.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can buy designs with special features that do everything however add the salt, you will pay for each extra function. The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm assurance that the special feature will not fail. Depending on the water source, you might have to filter turbid water or decontaminate bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening system.

In either case, scalding water threatens and must be immediately resolved by a skilled plumbing professional.</p>
