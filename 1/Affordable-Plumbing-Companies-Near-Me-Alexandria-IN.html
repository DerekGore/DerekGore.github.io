When your water lines are repiped, it simply implies old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing major and regular leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping. If you do have regular leaks, we find that repiping can really be the less expensive and better long-term solution.</p>
