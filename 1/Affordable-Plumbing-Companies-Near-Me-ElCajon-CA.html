<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a significant clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
