<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
