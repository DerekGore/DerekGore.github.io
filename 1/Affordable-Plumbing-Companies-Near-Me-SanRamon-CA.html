<p>Backflow preventers are critical for developing a safe supply of water system. No matter which model you select, all water softeners need to be effectively preserved. The brine option should be mixed and stored in the brine tank. Regular blocking of the resin likewise requires special attention. For example, if the raw water system is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. Often, typical backwashing with water will fix this issue. If not, gradually stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help break up the material. Also, fungi and germs also form mats in the resin that lower its efficiency. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these annoyances. However, read the manufacturer's guidelines prior to adding any chemicals to the system.</p>
