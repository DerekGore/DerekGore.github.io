I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
