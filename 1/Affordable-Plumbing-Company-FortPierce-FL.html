<p>Woodbury, along with many other neighborhoods and organizations, has actually discovered the best way to prevent these discolorations from taking place is by lowering the variety of times your water softener regrows. "Restoring" refers to the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it becomes "exhausted" or complete. Nevertheless, numerous water softeners regenerate too often, when the filter medium actually isn't full. This can be fixed by simply resetting your water softener to eliminate less solidity or to run longer in between regeneration cycles.</p>

If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that ranges from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water gets into your toilet.
