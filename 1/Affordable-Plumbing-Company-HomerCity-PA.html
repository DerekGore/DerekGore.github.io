<p>In local water system systems, water is normally kept at a considerable pressure to allow water to stream to and out of the plumbing components in your home or company. When the pressure drops for some reason such as might take place when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to fight a fire or a water main breaks or some other circumstance takes place, contaminated water may be drawn into the system. To avoid such an occurrence, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention approach used.

Low Flow Toilets: While low flow toilets are terrific at saving you cash on your water expenses, some older models lack the flushing power to appropriately eliminate waste, which results in buildups.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
