<h3>Blocked Sewer in Connellsville PA - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>

For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that speed up corrosion Likewise, there is a lack of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of deterioration control. Thus, thinking about all these aspects, as well as arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that a correctly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
