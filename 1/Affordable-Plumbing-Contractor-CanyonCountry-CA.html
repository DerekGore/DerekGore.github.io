<p>Deterioration is a complicated phenomenon and there are numerous aspects that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and premise plumbing. For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that accelerate rust Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of deterioration control. Hence, considering all these elements, in addition to arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
<p>While lots of water heater problems can be successfully repaired, some problems will require total water heater replacement. If your hot water heater is past its typical lifespan (usually anywhere from 8 to ten years or longer if you have a tankless water heater) or if it has a major leak or comprehensive rust, it may be time to think about replacement.</p>
