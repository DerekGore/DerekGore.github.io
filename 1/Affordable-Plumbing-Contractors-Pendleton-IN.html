The only issue is that potassium chloride is expensive: $25 to $30 per 50-pound bag. Salt costs $4 to $6 per bag. A hydro jetter is a pump-and-hose system that uses high-powered water jets to clear residential and commercial drain pipes. Most high-pressure water jetters will operate with approximately 4,000 PSI of pressure and will push anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>
