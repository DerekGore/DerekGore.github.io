<p>Check the status of your water heater's anode rod if you see rust just in your hot water. If you've never done this on your own, you may need a professional to do this. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is probably coming from the inside of your water heater. Replace your water heater as quickly as possible if this holds true.

<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. A reaction team is readily available for initial examination of sewer emergency situations every day of the year. If sewage from the City-maintained portion of the sewer system backs up through toilets or sinks, call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700. City workers will inspect and eliminate obstructions in the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line that the City is accountable for. You might have to wait up until the storm has diminished to have the backup fixed if the problem is the outcome of too much storm water in the system.</p>
<p>2 styles of PVBs are available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. A PVB might be used to isolate health or non-health dangers but is effective against back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a momentary fix. It's a long-term solution for the whole plumbing system in your home or organisation. We shut off the water system, remove old pipe and replace it with new pipe. After the new system is installed, we turn the water on and carry out tests on the brand-new system. As soon as the system passes our tests, it's good to opt for you.</p>
