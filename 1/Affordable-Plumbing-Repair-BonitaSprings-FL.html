<p>Repiping a house takes three to 5 days with a typical cost from $5,500 to $8,500, depending upon home's size and the company doing the work. Wood recommends examining the certifications of various companies and getting estimates. With all this in mind, it's clear why water softeners are so popular: They stay the least costly and most reliable method to rid your water of troublesome minerals.</p>

Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water stains and corrosion.
