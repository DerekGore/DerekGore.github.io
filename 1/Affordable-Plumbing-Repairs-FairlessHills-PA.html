<p>DCVs are specifically created to prevent backflow in fire sprinkler systems.

<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which styles are best for specific applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are defined by environmental policies and local statutes. Local building regulations for example will need a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any possible siphon before it can occur, avoiding infecting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more complex and sophisticated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices installed to avoid backflow range from the relatively easy to the very sophisticated and complicated.</p>
