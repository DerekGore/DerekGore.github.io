<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leaks happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these concerns.</p>
