Water pressure may be or fail decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to remove.</p>
