<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services BallstonLake NY</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leaks happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these issues.</p>
