<p>Backflow preventers ought to only be fixed when the data collected from the field test indicates the assembly has actually broken down in its efficiency below the established minimum standard. The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if required, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working requirements. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
