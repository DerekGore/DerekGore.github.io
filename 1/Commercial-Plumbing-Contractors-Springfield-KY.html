<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is normal in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace.
