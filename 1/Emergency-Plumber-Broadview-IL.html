Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
