<p>The next step we must perform in the repair process, is to flush the incoming water line. After we have cleaned up the body, and the repaired components are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or particles. This can be difficult, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is essential that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be made use of to assure the line is appropriately flushed.</p>
<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a process called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
