<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive product. Some disposer units do not included a power cord connected. Eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1) if this is the case.

Hidden sets of pipes utilize pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet.
