<p>Spotty meals? Distribution pipes shift to even smaller specific service pipes, carrying water to specific homes, home buildings, businesses and stores. Depending upon need, these pipes range in size from a half inch in size to 6 inches. Water goes into the customer center through a water meter that tapes circulation rates and water utilization for billing functions. Specific service pipelines are typically made from type, plastic or lead K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
