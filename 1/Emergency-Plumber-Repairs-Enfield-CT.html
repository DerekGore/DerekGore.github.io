The resultant space breaks any potential siphon prior to it can occur, preventing polluting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more complicated and sophisticated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets set up to prevent backflow range from the reasonably basic to the complex and extremely sophisticated.</p>
