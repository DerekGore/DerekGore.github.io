<p>The most reliable method to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.

Fire protection system are designed to match the risk that exists in the places they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be extremely different, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be designed and set up to satisfy that specific danger or need.

The backflow protection requirements for these two examples would also differ greatly.</p>
