<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber PassChristian MS</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that go through fouling, wear or tiredness. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. Therefore, all backflow preventers have to be checked occasionally to ensure they are functioning correctly. A visual check of air spaces is sufficient, however mechanical backflow preventers need to be tested with appropriately calibrated gauge devices.</p>
