<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the drinkable system providing the make-up water, backpressure is developed. This can force the drinkable water to reverse its instructions of flow through the cross-connection between the two systems. Possible impurities can then enter the drinkable water supply. The very best way to reduce accumulation is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly tough with high mineral material, you may need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>
