<p>The repair specialist must be able to identify the many various makers and the particular designs produced for many years. Some designs might seem similar on the outdoors but could need various repair parts on the within, so the repair technician need to be able to determine the make, design and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that might have been produced.

It is necessary to know the correct design to assure you get the proper repair parts.</p>

<p>Your disposer might include a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the conventional plumber's putty as laid out listed below. Both will create a good seal (though the gasket may lead to small amounts of water collecting around the flange), and what's utilized is largely a matter of preference. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's harder to eliminate.</p>
