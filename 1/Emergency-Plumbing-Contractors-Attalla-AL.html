At Hall's Plumbing, we deal with Forest, CA property owners whenever they need repiping service or pipe repair.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air.

This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
