<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly.
