<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Chelmsford MA</h3>
<p>Aside from water dripping and the occasional creak, your pipes must not be making any odd sounds, particularly not ones loud enough to keep you up in the evening. If your pipes are rattling, clanking, banging or making other obnoxious noises, that's a surefire indication of a bigger issue. Have your pipes checked as quickly as possible so you don't wind up with a significant leak.</p>
<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Softeners primarily get rid of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently described as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they must be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a substantial warning that something more major is wrong with them.</p>
