<h3>Slab Leak Reroute in LakeGrove New York</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab.

Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly.
