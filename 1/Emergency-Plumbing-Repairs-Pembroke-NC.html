That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures.
