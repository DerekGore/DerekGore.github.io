A journeyman plumber and his assistant arrived throughout the designated time period. They unplugged the sinks, cleaned up and suggested a tool to be utilized in the future.</p>

Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet.
