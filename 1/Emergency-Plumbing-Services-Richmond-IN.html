<p>IRWD is committed to providing safe, high quality water to customers. Our substantial water quality program runs 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to guarantee that the water delivered to our consumers is kept free from harmful pollutants. A vital part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to equipment including a nonpotable compound, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination may happen when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating & cooling system, into the drinkable water system. This can take place through a procedure known as backflow.</p>
<p>A lot of softeners have a bypass developed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to offer some type of maintenance to it and even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's smart to build one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to preserve the unit.</p>

<p>5. Pour warm water down your drain after using the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, wash your drain with a bit of hot water.

Thankfully, you do not always need the support of a professional to fix it.</p>
