<p>Many softeners have a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to supply some type of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're working on installing it.

<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the polluted water to become a health threat if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, in addition to inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
