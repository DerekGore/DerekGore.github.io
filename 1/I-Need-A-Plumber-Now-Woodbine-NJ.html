<p>During typical operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of decreased pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is designed to open and release water to the outside if either check valve need to leak. An RPZ will periodically discharge small amounts of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be set up in areas that are not subject to water damage and enable sufficient drainage.</p>
