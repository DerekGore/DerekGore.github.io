<h3>High Pressure Hydro-Jetting in Winfield Illinois</h2>
<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical circulation direction within a piping system that is caused by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are set up in areas where water might trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
