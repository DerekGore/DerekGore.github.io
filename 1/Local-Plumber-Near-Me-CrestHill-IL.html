Dissolved calcium and magnesium speed up out of tough water as scale, which builds up on the insides of pipes, hot water heater, tea kettles, coffee machine and commercial equipment. Scale minimizes flow through pipes and is a poor conductor of heat. Eventually, pipes can become entirely clogged.</p>
