However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Frequent leakages: Leakages originating from your hot water heater are never a great sign. If your water heater has frequent leakages or is constantly needing repairs, it is likely more cost-effective to replace the entire system. A backflow preventer is a device that's set up on your home's pipes that allows water to flow in one direction but never in the opposite instructions. Its sole job is to avoid drinking water from being infected due to backflow.</p>
<p>If your water heater has actually needed numerous repairs over the last couple of years, it may be time to get it changed. A great guideline for water heaters is this: due to the fact that the life expectancy of the typical water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. If the cost of a repair is majority the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your hot water heater.</p>
<p>Worse yet ... you arrive home after a great night out just to discover your house or garage is flooded since from your water heater leaking. Master plumbers shall not allow any apprentice plumber, or unlicensed journeyman plumber, in their use or otherwise under their guidance, to do plumbing work of any kind, including repairs and clearing interruptions of drains, unless said master plumber is physically present and taking an active part in stated work.</p>
