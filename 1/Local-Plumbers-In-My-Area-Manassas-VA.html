<p>If you need a water softener is a personal preference, identifying. A permit is not required for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages provided modifications are not made in the existing piping or components. A typical water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, wide brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a neighboring drain or drywell.</p>
