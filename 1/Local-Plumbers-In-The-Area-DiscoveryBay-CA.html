<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>
