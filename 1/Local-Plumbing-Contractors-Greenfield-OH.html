<p>Softeners primarily eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently described as 'hardness minerals'.

If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
