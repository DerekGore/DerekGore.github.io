<p>You'll see that water runs to refill the bowl Whenever you flush your toilet. However, in a properly working toilet, the water must stop running as soon as the bowl is filled to its appropriate capacity. Opportunities are you have an internal leak and water is being dumped down the overflow if your toilet continues to run. These leaks are very wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water wind up traveling through the overflow.</p>

Sometimes simple repairs, such as unclogging a drain or a toilet, will have a repaired cost of about $220 unless there are extenuating circumstances. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13. Some plumbers will charge a cost to look at your scenario and inform you what needs to be done, however if you employ them, that charge will be deducted from the bill. A plumber may charge $50-$ 100 to come and detect the problem. 2 Having to call a plumber after hours, on the weekend, or on a holiday will cost more.</p>
