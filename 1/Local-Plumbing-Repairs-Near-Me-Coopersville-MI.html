<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
