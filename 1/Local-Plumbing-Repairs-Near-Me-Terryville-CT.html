<h3>Useful Tips for Water Heater Repair at Terryville CT</h3>
<p>Deterioration is a complex phenomenon and there are lots of factors that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For many years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that accelerate rust Also, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient type of rust control. Hence, considering all these factors, as well as arise from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
