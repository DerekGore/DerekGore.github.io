When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum basic, the backflow preventer need to be repaired or if required, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
