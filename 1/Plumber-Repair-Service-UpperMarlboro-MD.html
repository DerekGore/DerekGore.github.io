For example, if your kitchen sink is backed up due to the fact that you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a quick drain snaking can break up the blockage and send it down the pipes. We recommend you go with drain snaking rather of using strong chemical drain cleaners. These store-bought cleaners might do more damage than good by corroding your pipes.</p>
