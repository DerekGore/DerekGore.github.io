<p>If the sodium bicarbonate and white vinegar method does not work, follow with a plunger. Fill the sink with water and vigorously plunge up and down for a number of minutes to remove the clog. When working with a double bowl kitchen sink, stuff the other opening with a rag, which helps apply extra pressure to the clog. For clogs that occur further down the pipe, utilize a cable auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made from long, flexible steel cable wound around a spool with a hand crank. To use a cable television auger, get rid of the horizontal P-trap below the sink, making certain it is not clogged prior to proceeding. Take out 18 inches of cable television at a time, crank the handle in a clockwise direction and press the auger forward at the same time.
