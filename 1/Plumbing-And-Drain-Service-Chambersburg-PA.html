<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mostly time related. If everything is ready, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or more of time. If things need to be customized, changed, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours needed and therefore the total expenses. Most plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with a lot of disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
<p>How much is a sewer line inspection? These specialized evaluations consist of specialized camera equipment that faces your sewer line. If you've identified pooling water in the backyard, a camera inspection is a lot more palatable than trenching through the backyard. This will cost you (typically) between $300-$ 400. Master plumber licenses are awarded to plumbers who have held a journey license for a particular amount of time, and have accumulated the required hours working as a licensed journey plumber. In addition, a master plumber also has to pass a state sanctioned test.</p>
