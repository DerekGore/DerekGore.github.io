<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board advises the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections concerning the administration of Short article 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, consisting of licensing. Backsiphonage occurs when there is a negative pressure in the water circulation system, which draws the water from a private water supply into the general public water supply.

<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately begins. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regrowth normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
