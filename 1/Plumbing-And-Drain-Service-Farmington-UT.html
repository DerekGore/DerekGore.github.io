<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Farmington UT</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leaks happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these problems.</p>
