<p>You might be dealing with regular plumbing issues if you're living in an old house that's never been remodelled. Even if you don't have substantial problems, it's wise to repipe your house to secure your property and avoid more substantial issues in the future. Here are signs saying you need a repipe company.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug package that I bought independently from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
