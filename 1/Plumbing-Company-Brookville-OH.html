<p>To avoid these things from blocking your drains and causing damage, Larry & Sons recommends that you utilize hair and food stoppers throughout your house. These nifty additions to your tubs and sinks can lower the amount of hair and food scraps that wind up in your drains. Many garbage disposals will need a new sink drain flange, which consists of the metal disk at the drain entryway at the bottom of the sink in addition to a short length of pipe that extends below the sink, where the drain attaches.</p>
<p>At least once every 3 months, drain water from the tank. Over time sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct performance, and draining pipes a gallon or so helps get rid of the sediment. If you identify a leak and select a patching task instead of a repiping job, just bear in mind that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the very same product and they might be next. To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may want to consider repiping your entire house when you spot a leak.</p>
