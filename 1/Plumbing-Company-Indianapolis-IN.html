<p>If these combinations aren't effective in unclogging your sink, reach for a common household plunger. If you have a double sink, first seal off the 2nd side with a damp cloth or a stopper. You'll need to create a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you intend to plunge with sufficient water to cover the bell of the plunger. Location the plunger strongly over the drain and plunge intensely a number of times. Get rid of the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water when you hear the suction clear the clog.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were very responsive and timely to send me a bid which was extremely competitive. They were really professional and did an amazing job. I would certainly call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration just appears when warm water is being used, then the rust most likely exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still an issue that needs to be handled right now (you'll likely need a new water heater) but not one that requires repiping.</p>
