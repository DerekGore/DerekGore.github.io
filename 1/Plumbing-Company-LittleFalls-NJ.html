<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually typically been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to overstated advertising and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment.

The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
