<p>Both irrigation water and clean water supply are at high risk of coming into contact with pollutants due to backflows. Numerous faucets can have a low-flow aerator installed at the outlet end of the water spout.

<p>The most efficient way to resolve hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.
