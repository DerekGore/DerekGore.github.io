These 2 pieces have complementary grooves that when properly fitted together hold the mount ring and disposal in location. Holding the mount ring at the upper part of the flange, work the cushion install over the bottom of the flange, making sure that the rubber of the cushion install is completely and securely locking into the groove on the bottom of the flange. When installed correctly, you need to not be able to remove the cushion install without significant pulling and extending, and the install ring should rotate freely around it.</p>
