A garbage disposal generally plugs into a 120-volt GFCI (ground-fault circuit interruptor) outlet under the sink. If an outlet like this isn't readily available under your sink, you'll need to have an electrician install one.</p>
<p>Every water heater we install has been evaluated under the most extreme water temperature levels and was built to last a very long time. When your existing hot water heater begins failing, a brand-new installation may cost cash in advance, however it can save you hundreds or even countless dollars in the long run.

That's why residents of Centreville, Fairfax, Herndon, Reston, Leesburg, and other parts of Northern Virginia have been utilizing Service Specializeds for hot water heater installations for almost 40 years now.

<p>You reside in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done quickly.

If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you don't already have one. This typically includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
