<p>Water heater repair and water heater installation are typically delayed as long as possible. A hot water heater is a pricey plumbing home appliance, and we tend to push off replacing it till it breaks beyond repair.

It's important to go out in front of any problems as fast as possible. The quicker you respond to a concern, the better possibility you'll have to save time and money on hot water heater services.</p>
