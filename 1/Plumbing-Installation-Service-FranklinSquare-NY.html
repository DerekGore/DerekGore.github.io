Recurring leaks and repairs.

<p>Plumbing and piping innovation has enhanced over the last thirty years. Copper has actually been the preferred option to replace galvanized iron pipes (which used to be considered really strong, but they were discovered to break under pressure and tend to rust within a couple of years). Today, the majority of quality contractors use PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>Extremely frequently the circular blade within is stuck. DO NOT REACH INSIDE TO FREE IT! Just place a long, sturdy, wood handle (a broom handle will be adequate) into the opening. Let it rest against the inside wall, and with force pushing down, turn clockwise until you feel it turn freely. It might be necessary to reset the disposal. Find the reset switch on the bottom of the unit if so. If the clog persists, utilize any type of drain cleaner to release it.</p>
