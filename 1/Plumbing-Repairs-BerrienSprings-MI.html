Hard water triggers white or gray deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be used to minimize these signs.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
