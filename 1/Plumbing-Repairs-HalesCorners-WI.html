<p>To figure out which toilet valve is causing the problem, look at the overflow tube. If water is overflowing into the tube, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve.

That sluggish, consistent outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water discolorations and deterioration.
