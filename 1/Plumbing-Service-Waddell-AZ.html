<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system needs to be continuously kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>When homeowners need fast toilet repair, they rely on the most relied on: Sicari Plumbing. We offer our clients years of experience, competitive prices, quick service and qualified licensed repair specialists who not only deal with repairs common to toilets but who can also deal with problems with the sit-down bidet systems often attached to the toilet mechanism.</p>
