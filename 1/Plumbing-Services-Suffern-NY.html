<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Suffern NY</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
