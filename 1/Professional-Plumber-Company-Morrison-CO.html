With the everyday usage of gas, it is reasonable it is understandable that gradually a leak is bound to happen. When a leak appears, it is important to understand the signs, signs, and how to act.

<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
