<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain.

<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health danger if permitted to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, as well as checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
