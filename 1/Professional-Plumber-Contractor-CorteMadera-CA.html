<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service CorteMadera CA</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer might be required to be located on the water service line, within the structure, or both locations. After an initial inspection and testing of a newly installed backflow preventer, the water customer is needed to have the backflow preventer evaluated on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
