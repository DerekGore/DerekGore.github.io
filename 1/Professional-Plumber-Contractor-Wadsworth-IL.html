<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
