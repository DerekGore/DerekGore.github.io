<p>To reduce the need of gas line repair, it's important to understand the common reasons for gas leaks. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning appliances happen most commonly in the winter. This is because homes are not effectively aerated throughout the cooler months to prevent heat loss. We recommend installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to alert you of any potential gas leakages if you haven't done so already.</p>
