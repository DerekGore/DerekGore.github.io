Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make certain to take the proper preventative measures if utilizing one of these products.</p>

To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to consider repiping your whole house when you find a leak.</p>
