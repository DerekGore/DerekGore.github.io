Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leakages occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these concerns.</p>
