When your water lines are repiped, it just suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing regular and significant leakages, you might be in need of water line repiping.
