<p>Install extremely economical low-flow aerators for bathroom and kitchen faucets. Entire home filtration systems can get rid of chlorine and other damaging chemicals from all of your water sources and enhance your water taste, quality, and color for drinking, bathing, cleaning, and washing.

<p>A backflow preventer is a way or mechanism to prevent backflow. The fundamental methods of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The basic mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET provided by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We suggest, as most plumbers do, to use disposals sparingly. Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
