<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede versus the required instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being polluted. There is potential for the infected water to become a health danger if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for effectiveness, as well as checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
