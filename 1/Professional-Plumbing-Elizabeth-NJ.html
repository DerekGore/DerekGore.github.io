<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>

Prolonged guarantee: Most disposals feature at least a 1-year warranty, however if you purchase one with a life time service warranty (15+ years), it will most likely be more expensive.

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the perpetrator. However not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
