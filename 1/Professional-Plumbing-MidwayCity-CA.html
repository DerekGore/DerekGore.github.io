For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate deterioration Also, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of rust control. Therefore, considering all these elements, as well as results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
