<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leaks occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these concerns.</p>
