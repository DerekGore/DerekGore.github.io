<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is normally used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start again.</p>
<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most widespread and destructive water problems: hard water.  Hard water damaged the modern house. Scale builds up in your pipes, clogging them and reducing water pressure.  Scale dramatically reduces the life expectancy of home appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee machine and ice machines. Difficult water ruins hot water devices. The higher the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and solidify into solid deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>
