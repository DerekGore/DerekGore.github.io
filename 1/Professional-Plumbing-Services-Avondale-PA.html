<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were extensively used in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>

These leakages are extremely wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water wind up traveling through the overflow.</p>
