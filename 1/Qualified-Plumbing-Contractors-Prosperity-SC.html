<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly.
