<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is comprised of 6 State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, one of which is likewise serves as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Plan Examiner for the group. There are couple of circumstances when plumbing inspections are mandatory, but the biggest exceptions are building and construction and home updates. If you decide to take on a bathroom remodel (for example), you'll have to set up at least two assessments, including a rough-in inspection of the new piping and a final checkup before linking your devices.</p>
<p>The bright side is that Preferred House Services can assist! Our skilled Charleston plumbers can help you recognize whether you need water heater repairs or replacement, and we can offer the solutions you need to restore your access to hot water.

Layout - Once you include a 2nd floor and even 3rd floor, pipes need to be run up to it. This is more intricate than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor extensive.
