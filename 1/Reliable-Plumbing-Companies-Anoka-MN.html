If either of these drawbacks are inappropriate to you - you'll wish to discover what's called a non-precipitating water softener. Turn on the water to fill the toilet tank. Pinch the spring clip and move the float up or down to set the water level 1 in. below the top of the overflow tube or to the water line marked on the tank.</p>
