The Pipe Pull technique interchanges harmed sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the usage of a tiny hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into location. All brand-new replacement pipes have a predicted life-span of one a century and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another effective strategy is pipe relining.
