Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
