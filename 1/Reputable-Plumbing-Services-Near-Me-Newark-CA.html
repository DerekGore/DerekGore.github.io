<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the defective pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to consider if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing.

If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is developed to open and discharge water to the outside.

For this reason, the RPZ should be set up in locations that are exempt to water damage and allow adequate drainage.</p>
