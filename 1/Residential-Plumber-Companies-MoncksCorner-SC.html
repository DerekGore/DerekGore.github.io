<p>State you choose to go that path. The next concern is whether you can install it yourself. Put it by doing this, if you're a knowledgeable useful individual, however you've never handled this specific repair, you can probably do it, providing you do your research. I would draw the line at attempting to install a power-vented gas-fired water heater (and some other specialized designs). Their installation needs to be handled by a licensed mechanical or plumbing contractor.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report must be offered to the City of Bellingham.
