When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If allowed to return to the supply of water, there is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health threat.
