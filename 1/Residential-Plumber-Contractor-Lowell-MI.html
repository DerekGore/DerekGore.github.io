Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leaks occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these concerns.</p>
