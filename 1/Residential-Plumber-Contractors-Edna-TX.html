<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>After inspection, a part or the work thereof shall be noted as acceptable as completed, or the permit holder will be informed regarding where the work fails to abide by the Uniform Code. Building and construction work not in compliance with code arrangements will be required to remain exposed until it has been brought into compliance with the code, been re inspected, and been found satisfactory as finished.</p>
