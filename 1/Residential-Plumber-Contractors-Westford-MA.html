<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Westford MA</h3>
<p>The most effective method to resolve hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as tough water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>

<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Westford MA</h3>
<p>Typically, there are tank water heaters that utilize either natural gas or electricity for their fuel. Gas tank units use nearly 50% less energy, costing less to run, than the electrical variety. However, they cost a bit more than electric models. When either temperature or pressure surpasses predetermined levels, they also include a temperature and pressure-release valve that opens. We offer gas water heater service, along with electric hot water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Coast.</p>
<p>Old Drains: Old drains often suffer damage either from tree roots or settling of the home's structure, which restrict water flow through the plumbing. Whether you need us to do an indoor drain cleaning or clear out your sewer line, we'll finish the job fast. We'll discover the clog and remove it as quickly and efficiently as possible. Before long, your water and sewage will be flowing freely again and you will not have to worry about drains and sewer lines any longer.</p>
<p>Gas lines featured outer covers that are primarily made from plastic. Remove them to expose the gas pipes below. Place on a gas mask given that breathing in such gases is dangerous for your breathing system. Make sure to use gloves as well. Electric water heaters likewise heat water inside a storage tank for distribution throughout your home. In this case, two electric heating elements managed by individual thermostats are responsible for heating the water inside the tank.</p>
<p>Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the issue became worse. Waiting just wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely costly alternative.</p>
