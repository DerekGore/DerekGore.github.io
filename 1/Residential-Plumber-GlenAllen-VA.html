<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber GlenAllen VA</h3>
<p>Corrosion: The most typical problem is rust in the tank and pipes that connect to your hot water heater. This is particularly real if you have neglected hard water, which consists of harsh minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the product in time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another aspect that is triggering the rust, you will eventually experience a leak in your hot water heater that is difficult to repair. Leakages often imply a new unit replacement is in order.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
