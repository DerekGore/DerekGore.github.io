Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>

After they provided me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing.
