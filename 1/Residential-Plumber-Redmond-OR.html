<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually frequently been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to overstated marketing and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening merely eliminates hardness minerals and removes problems that are an annoyance and not a threat to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not requirement. However, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>
<p>Often you understand you have a sewer line break due to the fact that you can smell foul smells or you have a sewage back-up in your house. It is very important to pinpoint the specific area of the break in your sewer line. Oftentimes the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can save you countless dollars in repairs. Merely sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can fix the problem. The specialists and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you constantly have a copy for your insurance city, company or realtor inspector.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the offender. However not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger problem too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
