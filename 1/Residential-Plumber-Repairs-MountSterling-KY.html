<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service MountSterling KY</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, permitting air to get in the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient climatic standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
