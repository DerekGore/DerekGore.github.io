<p>Backflow preventers must only be fixed when the data gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has broken down in its performance listed below the established minimum basic. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum basic, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if necessary, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working requirements. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
