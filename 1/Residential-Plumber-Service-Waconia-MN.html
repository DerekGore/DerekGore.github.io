<p>As discussed earlier in the article, carbon monoxide gas is totally odor free and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide gas detector. Every home should have carbon monoxide detectors set up at the correct areas. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family houses to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are usually sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all new setups should have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
<p>Softeners mainly get rid of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are typically described as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they should be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a substantial warning that something more severe is wrong with them.</p>
<p>Having your plumbing repiped can save you cash and time as well as safeguard your health in the future. After softening a large amount of tough water, the exchange medium becomes covered with calcium and magnesium ions. When this happens, the exchange medium must be charged or restored (Figure 1). No matter what the cause, Rainaldi has the experience, tools and know-how to fix your sewer, water line or drain problem right now. Contact us for aid or for more information on your responsibility for main sewer and water lines.</p>
