<p>Deterioration is an intricate phenomenon and there are many factors that accelerate rust in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that accelerate corrosion Also, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable kind of deterioration control.
