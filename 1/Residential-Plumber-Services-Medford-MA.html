<p>The consumer has thirty days to complete installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (check the due date on Notice of Requirements form). The majority of the time, a professional plumber can come out and find the issue and make the repairs. In some instances, the toilet may be too old, and replacement parts are not readily available, so a replacement toilet is required.</p>
<p>There's a good possibility it's because the garbage disposal is clogged if the sink is no longer draining as quickly as it once did.
