<p>One of the most severe hot water heater problems is leaking water, which is in some cases triggered by malfunctioning temperature level and pressure (T&P) relief valves.

<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to prevent backflow. The basic methods of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The basic system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
<p>At least when every three months, drain water from the tank. In time sediment constructs at the bottom of the heater, which can hinder performance, and draining pipes a gallon or two helps eliminate the sediment. If you identify a leak and select a patching task instead of a repiping task, simply remember that all the pipes in your house are most likely made from the very same material and they may be next. To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may want to consider repiping your entire house when you find a leak.</p>
