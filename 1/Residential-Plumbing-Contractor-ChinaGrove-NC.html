<p>The program achieves its mission by providing for the adoption and promulgation of suitable guidelines and policies for the construction of plumbing facilities where mandated. When identifying the solidity of water, there are series of grains per gallon (gpg). Rinckey stated that both Belding and Greenville city water steps around 18 gpg, which is considered incredibly hard water, leaving indications like spotty glasses and soap scum that is beside difficult to remove.
