<p>When selecting the correct system defense there are several factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be looked at on an individual basis as an unique stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems contains the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire defense system are developed to match the threat that exists in the areas they are set up in. As building types and contents of these structures can be very various, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be created and set up to meet that specific threat or need. An aircraft hangar will need a really different fire security system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow security requirements for these 2 examples would likewise vary greatly.</p>
