And who wishes to do all that work??? In all seriousness however, making sure your journey lever is working well can save you the inconvenience of those little daily troubles - that the majority of people simply live with and never recognize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to discuss the gallons of water lost every day by a poor seal.</p>
