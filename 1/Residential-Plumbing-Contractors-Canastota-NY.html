<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to offer some type of maintenance to it or even while you're dealing with installing it.
