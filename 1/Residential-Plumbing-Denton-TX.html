<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>

Where other drain cleaning and plumbing companies will attempt to charge you an arm and a leg to collect and clean your sewer line, Northwest Drain Station offers hydro jetting, an extremely efficient solution for dislodging persistent materials that have actually stayed with the walls of your pipeline, restoring a healthy circulation to your drains.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and on-line in reaction to the water demands of your carwash.

However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
