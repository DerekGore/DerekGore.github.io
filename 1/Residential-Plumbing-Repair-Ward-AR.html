<p>Say you decide to go that route. The next question is whether you can install it yourself. Put it by doing this, if you're a skilled helpful person, but you've never managed this specific repair, you can probably do it, providing you do your homework.

Their installation must be managed by a licensed mechanical or plumbing contractor.</p>
<p>We've detailed the procedure we advise for discovering an excellent plumber. Now let's look at the services a great plumber should provide. Disconnect the drain trap from the discharge tube. Disconnect the disposal from the dishwasher connection if needed.
