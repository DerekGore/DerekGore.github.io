After we have actually cleaned the body, and the repaired components are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or particles. This can be challenging, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be used to ensure the line is correctly flushed.</p>
<p>When the end user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water streams in the typical instructions from the supplier, downstream to fill the user's need. The flow of water presses the spring-loaded check valves open. The tension of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure distinction in the Zone of Decreased Pressure. This difference in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water flows in the regular instructions.</p>
