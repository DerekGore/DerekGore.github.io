<p>Sometimes, our professionals will recommend that you replace your water heater rather than invest in repairs. This is typically the case when the water heater is more than 10 years old or the cost of repairs would total more than half the cost of an entire new system. In some cases a troublesome toilet just requires a small adjustment and life is back to regular. That is why we provide a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) adjust the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) carry out a color test.</p>
<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water passes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is normally used in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
<p>Examine water or air test on system. Water test not less than the water working pressure of the system. Air test for piping systems other than plastic, not less than 50 psi. The test shall be held for not less than 15 minutes without leakages. Our Olympia water heater installation specialists can assist you pick the best make and design for your budget plan and your household's hot water requirements.</p>
