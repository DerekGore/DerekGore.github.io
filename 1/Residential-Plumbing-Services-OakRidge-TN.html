But where backflow preventers are most important remains in the supply of safe and clean water for individual and domestic usage.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

When searching for plumbing services in the area, be specific with your requirements and ask prospects if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the sophisticated experience and licenses related to a plumbing contractor.</p>
