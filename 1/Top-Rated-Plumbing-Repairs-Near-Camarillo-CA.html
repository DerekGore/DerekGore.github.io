Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. There is capacity for the polluted water to end up being a health danger if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for effectiveness, along with inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
