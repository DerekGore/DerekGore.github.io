<p>Garbage disposals are an essential function in any modern kitchen. If you reside in an older house, your sink might not have one, forcing you to be diligent about keeping food scraps from flowing down the drain. It's also possible for a disposal to suddenly break, bringing cooking or cleanup to a grinding halt. Copper pipes = $1.50-$ 2.00 per linear foot. Copper pipes are environmentally friendly and are resistant to splitting. Nevertheless, they're also the most costly in this list and in locations with difficult water (like Florida) they can establish pinhole leaks.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your home.

For instance, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several mixes of this type of backup. The point is your drains all link, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from numerous drain lines in your home.</p>
