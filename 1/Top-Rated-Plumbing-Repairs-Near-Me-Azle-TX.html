<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
