<p>When you remove the cap to eliminate the valve, inspect the washer for wear or fractures. Changing a bad washer is easy and inexpensive. However discovering the best washer may not be. The most typical washers are frequently readily available at home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be tough to discover. Remove it and take it to the store to discover a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers generally replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
