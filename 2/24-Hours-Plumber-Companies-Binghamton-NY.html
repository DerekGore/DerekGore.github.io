Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
