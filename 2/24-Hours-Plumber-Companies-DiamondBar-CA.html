<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>By changing the worn away and rusted galvanized metal pipe with brand-new copper pipes, your home will have cleaner and better-tasting water. Repiping likewise ensures that water pressure is higher. Something to consider is the energy-efficiency rating of various water heaters.

<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET provided by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We advise, as a lot of plumbers do, to use disposals moderately. Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
