<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately interacting that you can attain this.</p>
