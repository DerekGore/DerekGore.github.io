<h3>Clogged Tub in Ramona California</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had actually backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least three attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his understanding and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the newly cleaned main drain.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, but if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
