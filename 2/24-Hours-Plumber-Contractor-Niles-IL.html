<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has typically been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due mainly to overstated marketing and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening simply removes hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are an annoyance and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not need. However, water softening does have benefits, and drawbacks, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
<p>After showing up after their window, they started to examine the kitchen sink (and after among the two gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but declared they would not take duty if it leaked now due to the fact that of some unspecified curiosity in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, since I never ever wish to see this company again.</p>
