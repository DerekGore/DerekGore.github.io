As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others.

Electric water heaters also heat water inside a storage tank for circulation throughout your home. In this case, 2 electric heating components controlled by specific thermostats are responsible for heating the water inside the tank.</p>
<p>Most of the times, a lack of warm water is brought on by a malfunctioning breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch.

In either case, scalding water is dangerous and must be immediately dealt with by a trained plumbing professional.</p>
