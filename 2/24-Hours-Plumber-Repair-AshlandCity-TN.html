Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can cause leakages. As these leakages take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these issues.</p>
