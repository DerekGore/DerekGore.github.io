<p>A water softener must be set up as near to the water's point of entry into your house as possible. This makes sure most of your plumbing and home appliances are reaping the benefits of carrying the softened water. It's particularly important to ensure your water softener is located before your water heater, as difficult water does the greatest damage to warm water devices. You will wish to install the softener in a dry, level location, like a basement or garage. It will need to be close to the water's main line, an electric outlet to turn on the system, and a drain for the brine solution from the regrowth cycle.</p>
<p>Since the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to end up being layered within, New houses constructed with copper pipes are specifically prone to corrosive water conditions. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new home for a period of three to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Numerous new homes are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
