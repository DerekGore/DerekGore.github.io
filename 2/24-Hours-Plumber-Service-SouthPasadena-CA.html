<h3>Blocked Drain Cleaning: Why Hire A Professional in SouthPasadena CA?</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
