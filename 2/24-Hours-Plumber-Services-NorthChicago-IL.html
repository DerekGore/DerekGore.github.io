<p>The next action we should perform in the repair procedure, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have actually cleaned up the body, and the fixed parts are still out of the body, and we have finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or debris. This can be tricky, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is very important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be used to ensure the line is correctly flushed.</p>
