<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system must be continually kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
