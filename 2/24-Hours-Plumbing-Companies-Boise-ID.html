Entire house filtration systems can get rid of chlorine and other hazardous chemicals from all of your water sources and improve your water taste, quality, and color for drinking, bathing, cleaning, and washing.

But if your disposal is old enough, repairs will cost you cash for really little future usage.</p>

<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET provided by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We suggest, as most plumbers do, to use disposals sparingly.
