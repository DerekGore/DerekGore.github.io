<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
