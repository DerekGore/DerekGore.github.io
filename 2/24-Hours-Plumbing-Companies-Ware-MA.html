When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your house.

Salt is typically utilized in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>

<p>Water softeners leakages are mainly caused because of a concern at the point of installation or because of maintenance. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. It can also cause the system to leak if the bypass valve is cracked. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed gradually. A broken rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regrowth procedures. A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely broken and simply needs to be replaced.</p>

However, many homeowners and business owners have an out of sight, out of mind" technique to plumbing and do not evaluate their pipes till there is a pushing problem.
