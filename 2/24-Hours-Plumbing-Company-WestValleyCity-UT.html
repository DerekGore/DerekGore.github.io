<p>Great deals of bad things are being stated on this post about liners. I find that lots of old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no hint on what they are saying. Will also state something does not work well merely since they do not like the innovation and not since it doesn't work.

You'll also discover a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperature levels and managing the pilot-light valve.</p>
