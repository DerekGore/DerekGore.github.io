<h3>The Importance Of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Hamburg NY</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
