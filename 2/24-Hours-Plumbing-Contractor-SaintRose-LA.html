<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

Let it rest versus the inside wall, and with force pushing down, turn clockwise up until you feel it turn freely. It might be necessary to reset the disposal. If so, locate the reset switch on the bottom of the system. Use any type of drain cleaner to free it if the clog continues.</p>
