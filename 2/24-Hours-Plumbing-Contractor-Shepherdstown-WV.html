<h3>When Hiring A Plumber, Always Confirm The Price And Warranty Shepherdstown WV</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
