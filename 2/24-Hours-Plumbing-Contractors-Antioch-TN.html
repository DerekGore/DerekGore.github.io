<h3>Shower Repairs in Antioch TN - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>Do you need Leesburg VA sink repairs? Kiddco Plumbing can help! Fixing, replacing or setting up a new sink is one of those tasks that's a little harder to get done right than it appears. What looks like an easy task frequently develops into a weekend long inconvenience trying to fit the new sink into the opening, line up the water supply lines and drain pipes, install the faucets and other fixtures, and put the entire thing together so that the brand-new sink is strongly secured in place, all the plumbing fits and work properly and none of the water supply lines or drains leak.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of home centers carry only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close.
