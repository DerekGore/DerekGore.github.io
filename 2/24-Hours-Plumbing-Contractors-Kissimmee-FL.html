<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Kissimmee FL</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
