If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is developed to open and discharge water to the exterior. An RPZ will periodically discharge small amounts of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ must be set up in areas that are not subject to water damage and allow appropriate drainage.</p>
