<p>When deciding on the correct system defense there are several factors to consider we need to look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world.

Fire defense system are designed to match the danger that exists in the areas they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be really various, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be developed and set up to fulfill that specific threat or need. An aircraft garage will need an extremely different fire protection system than the system needed in an apartment. The backflow protection requirements for these 2 examples would also vary considerably.</p>
