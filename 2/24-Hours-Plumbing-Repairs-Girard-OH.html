Features such as these add cost, and aren't that efficient. Your best technique is to get the water heater with the 12 year service warranty. Chlorinated Polyvinylchloride Piping (CPVC) piping materials cost from $0.40 to $1.56 per direct foot.

<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is an unexpected decrease in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as throughout fire combating or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This reversal can develop a suction result and draw possible contaminants into the potable (drinking) water supply.
