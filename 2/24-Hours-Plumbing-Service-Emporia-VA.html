<p>The consumer has 1 month to finish installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (check the due date on Notification of Requirements form). Most of the time, a professional plumber can come out and find the problem and make the repairs. In some instances, the toilet might be too old, and replacement parts are not readily available, so a replacement toilet is needed.</p>

For local property owners, Service Team Plumbing provides reliable and professional Fort Worth whole house repiping services.

When water softening waste water is released into properly installed private septic systems, a recent septic tank study from the Water Quality Association clearly indicates that there are no negative impacts. There are several extra reports that also discuss more proof of the hardness ions in a softener's regeneration waste causing less blocking and preserving higher permeability than the regular sewage-disposal tank effluent.</p>
