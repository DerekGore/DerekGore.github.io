Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the suitable preventative measures.</p>
<p>While many water heater problems can be successfully repaired, some issues will require total hot water heater replacement.
