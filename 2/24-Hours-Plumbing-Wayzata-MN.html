<p>Many homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the external covering of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
