<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will collect in various parts of the plumbing system, many typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low flow concerns or perhaps stop a component from flowing altogether.

<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and germs from ending up being a problem in your water system by sending out an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system.
