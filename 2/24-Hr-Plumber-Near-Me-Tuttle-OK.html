<p>Backflow preventers are vital for creating a safe water supply system. No matter which design you choose, all water softeners need to be correctly kept. The brine service must be mixed and kept in the brine tank. Regular clogging of the resin also needs unique attention. For example, if the raw water supply is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, regular backwashing with water will fix this problem. If not, gradually stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help separate the material. Likewise, fungi and bacteria also form mats in the resin that decrease its effectiveness. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or occasionally cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these problems. However, check out the manufacturer's directions prior to adding any chemicals to the system.</p>
