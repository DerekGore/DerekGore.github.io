<p>There are a number of dead giveaways that will let you know you have a gas line leak in your home, and it is essential to focus on them. The gas pipe might be pierced or harmed if you notice a strong odor that resembles rotten eggs. You might also hear a hissing noise as the gas is getting away from the line, however that isn't always the case. If you smell rotten eggs, it is important to do something about it quickly to prevent any severe problems and to keep everyone safe.</p>
