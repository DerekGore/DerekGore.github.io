<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>

This resin is vacuum-packed to permit maximum capability in a minimum of area. Plus, our patented Directional Flow Screen system helps ensure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter likewise protect the resin bed, so we do not need to lose area on freeboard" which is the empty area in standard water softeners that permit a churning of resin throughout regrowth to launch dirt, sediment and hardness.</p>
