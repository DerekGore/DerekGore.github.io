<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, but if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Leaking in WadingRiver NY? The Way to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>The next step we must carry out in the repair process, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have cleaned the body, and the repaired elements are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet shut down to flush any rust or particles. This can be tricky, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be used to ensure the line is correctly flushed.</p>

Finally, if you own a septic system, you need to consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates suggest that about 50 gallons of water are utilized for each regrowth cycle. This may or might not cause hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
