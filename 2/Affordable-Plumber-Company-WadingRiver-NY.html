Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with.

<p>The next step we must carry out in the repair process, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have cleaned the body, and the repaired elements are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet shut down to flush any rust or particles. This can be tricky, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be used to ensure the line is correctly flushed.</p>

Finally, if you own a septic system, you need to consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates suggest that about 50 gallons of water are utilized for each regrowth cycle. This may or might not cause hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
