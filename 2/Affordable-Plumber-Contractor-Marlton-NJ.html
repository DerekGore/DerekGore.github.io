<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back against the needed direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health danger. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, as well as examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
