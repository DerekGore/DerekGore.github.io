<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains considerable amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its many desired uses around your home.</p>
<p>Most plumbers will eliminate the old unit to install the new one at the same per hour rate. This can increase the amount of time needed to install the brand-new unit, for that reason increasing costs. This actually depends upon what condition the remainder of the pipes are in, and how tough the old unit is to eliminate. In many cases, removal will only include an extra $25 to $50 to the total costs, however sometimes the costs could be greater if additional pipes must also be changed.</p>
