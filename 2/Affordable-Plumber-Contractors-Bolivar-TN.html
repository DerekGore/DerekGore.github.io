The best one for you depends upon just how much hot water you utilize, and the heating technique (electrical power, gas, oil). Some claim to reduce energy expenses by as much as 50 percent of standard storage models. The trade-off is that the initial costs are higher and your roi will take longer.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close.
