<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Frankfort IN</h3>
<p>Repiping a home takes 3 to five days with a typical cost from $5,500 to $8,500, depending on home's size and the company doing the work. Wood advises inspecting the certifications of numerous companies and getting estimates. With all this in mind, it's clear why water softeners are so popular: They remain the least costly and most efficient way to rid your water of troublesome minerals.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
