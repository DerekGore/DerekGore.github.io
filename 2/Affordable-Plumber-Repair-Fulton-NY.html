<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Fulton NY</h3>
<p>To reduce the need of gas line repair, it's important to understand the common causes of gas leaks. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning devices happen most frequently in the winter. This is since houses are not properly ventilated throughout the cooler months to prevent heat loss. If you have not done so currently, we suggest setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to alert you of any prospective gas leaks.</p>
<p>The watering backflow testing season is from May to September. Irrigation backflow prevention assemblies must be checked by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to ensure proper backflow prevention remains in place to protect our drinking water during the watering season. Denver Water will send out a testing reminder notification one month before the annual test is due.</p>
