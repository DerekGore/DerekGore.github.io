Then that generally implies that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience clogs in several drains at once in your house. This can occur in several places and any mix of drains. For instance, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
