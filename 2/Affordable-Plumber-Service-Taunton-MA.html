<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Taunton MA</h3>
<p>The most effective way to address hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
