<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>

I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel.
