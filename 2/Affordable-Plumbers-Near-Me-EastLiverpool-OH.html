Friendly, knowledgeable service technician. He got our drain cleaned out in a professional and really efficient way. I would not be reluctant to call Roto-Rooter for any future requirements. Toilet Runs Periodically - Do not you dislike it when the toilet runs 5 minutes after you flushed? It typically means there is a concern with the flapper, or the toilet is leaking water someplace.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were timely and really responsive to send me a bid which was really competitive. They were really professional and did a remarkable task. I would definitely call them once again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this staining only appears when warm water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still a problem that needs to be handled right now (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) however not one that needs repiping.</p>
