<h3>Drains Blocked Find A Good Emergency Plumber Now Rosedale MD</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX.

As these leaks happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these issues.</p>
