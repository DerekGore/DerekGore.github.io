<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the needed direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. If permitted to re-enter the water supply, there is capacity for the contaminated water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
