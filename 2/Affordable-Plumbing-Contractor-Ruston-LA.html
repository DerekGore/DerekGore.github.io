<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively utilized in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and channels, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
