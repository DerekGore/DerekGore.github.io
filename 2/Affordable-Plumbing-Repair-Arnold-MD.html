<p>Backflow preventers should only be repaired when the information collected from the field test indicates the assembly has deteriorated in its performance listed below the developed minimum basic. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer need to be fixed or if essential, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
