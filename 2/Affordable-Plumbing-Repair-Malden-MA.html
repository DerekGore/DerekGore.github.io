<p>It can be an unsafe job when it comes to gas line installation and repair. Attempting to install a gas line on your own can cause electrocution, fire, or electrical wiring issues.

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Most home centers bring only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>State you decide to go that path. The next question is whether or not you can install it yourself. Put it in this manner, if you're an experienced handy individual, however you have actually never managed this specific repair, you can probably do it, offering you do your homework. I would fix a limit at attempting to install a power-vented gas-fired water heater (and some other specific designs). Their installation ought to be dealt with by a licensed mechanical or plumbing contractor.</p>
