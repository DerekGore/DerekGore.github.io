When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can cause clogs, breaks, and back-ups which might result in comprehensive home damage. Watch out for moist, green patches in your backyard, a persistent sewage smell in or around your house, an uptick in insect and rodent activity, and slow drains, as these are all typical signs of root invasion.</p>
