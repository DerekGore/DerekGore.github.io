<p>We really appreciate our clients and the services that we supply. As difficult water travels through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with salt ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are changed easily by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this process, totally free" salt ions are launched into the water.

<p>If you see rust only in your warm water, then check the status of your hot water heater's anode rod. You may need a professional to do this if you've never ever done this by yourself. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is most likely coming from the inside of your hot water heater. Replace your hot water heater as soon as possible if this is the case. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your cold and hot water taps, you more than likely have actually rusted piping.</p>

After we have cleaned the body, and the repaired parts are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or debris. This can be difficult, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be utilized to assure the line is appropriately flushed.</p>
