<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by continuously bringing tanks on-line and off-line in action to the water needs of your carwash.

Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
