The extremely pressurized water can be directed into the drain to break up even the hardest blockages.

<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of significant surgery, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing regular and significant leakages. If you do have regular leaks, we find that repiping can in fact be the less expensive and better long-term solution.</p>
<p>House redesigning or house restorations are the best time to replace your house's pipes. However, if your home is constructed on a raised foundation then replacing the pipes can also be finished with minimal damage. Houses constructed on a slab structure can gain from having their pipes replaced though the amount of drywall patching and painting is normally higher.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and determine the cause of the problem. The line was clearly deteriorating; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
