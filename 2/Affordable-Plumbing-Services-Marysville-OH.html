<p>IRWD is devoted to providing safe, high quality water to customers. Our extensive water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water delivered to our clients is kept devoid of damaging impurities. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to devices including a nonpotable compound, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination might take place when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or cooling and heating system, into the drinkable water system. This can happen through a process known as backflow.</p>
