<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back against the required direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If enabled to return to the supply of water, there is potential for the infected water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, along with checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
