<p>If there are any lead pipes in the home, find out. Residences that were constructed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an environmental toxic substance (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have children, you might not wish to reside in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the issue got worse. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a very costly alternative.</p>
