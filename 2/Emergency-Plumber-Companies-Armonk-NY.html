<p>Pipeline video inspection is a form of telepresence utilized to visually inspect the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A typical application is for a plumber to determine the condition of small size sewer lines and household connection drain pipes. With unique root nozzles, we can clean and clear most of the roots, rust, and debris to prepare the line for possible CIPP lining reinstatement if the pipe needs to be repaired.

We have portable electrical systems for within your home or service and big gas and trailer units for outside problems.

While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself.
