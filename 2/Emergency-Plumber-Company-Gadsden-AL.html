During regeneration, salted water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer system computes the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically begins. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regrowth typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
