<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are many elements that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that speed up rust Also, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient type of corrosion control. Hence, thinking about all these elements, along with results from research study studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
