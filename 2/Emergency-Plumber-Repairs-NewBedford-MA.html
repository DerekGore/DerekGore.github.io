<p>Lots of bad things are being said on this post about liners. I discover that numerous old time plumbers are not informed on liners and have no hint on what they are saying. Because they don't like the innovation and not since it does not work, will likewise state something does not work well simply. The piping procedure adds to the installation costs if this heater is set up in a home with numerous bathrooms.</p>
