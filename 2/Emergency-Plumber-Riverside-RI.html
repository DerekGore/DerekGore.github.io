If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't installed correctly, you might experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in squandered water.</p>
