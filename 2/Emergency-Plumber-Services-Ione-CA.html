<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is common in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can achieve this.</p>
