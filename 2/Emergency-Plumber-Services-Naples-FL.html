If you need gas lines installed at your home or are checking out a re-pipe for your existing plumbing system, Green World Plumbing & Sewer is here to assist.

<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Many houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition security. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
