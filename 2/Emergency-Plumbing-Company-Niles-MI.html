<p>Backflow is dangerous because it can contaminate the public drinking supply with contaminants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and harmful chemicals. In 2010, for example, students at a Bowling Green, Kentucky elementary school suffered queasiness and other signs after a contractor working on the HEATING AND COOLING system triggered the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing frequent and major leakages, you might be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can actually be the less expensive and much better long-term option if you do have regular leakages.</p>
<p>There are a number of indicators that will let you know you have a gas line leak in your house, and it is important to take notice of them. If you observe a strong odor that resembles rotten eggs, then the gas pipe may be punctured or damaged. You may likewise hear a hissing sound as the gas is leaving from the line, but that isn't constantly the case. It is crucial to take action quickly to avoid any major problems and to keep everyone safe if you smell rotten eggs.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the handy self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. A number of homes in my area being repiped and have actually spoken with neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Apparently it begins with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can trigger major damage if the leak isn't detected quickly.</p>
