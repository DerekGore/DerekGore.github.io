<p>The most reliable way to resolve tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

<p>For instance, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Because pressure is lost throughout these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will stream in reverse into the city water lines. Although an EcoWater dealer does not support your area currently, we enjoy to help you with an alternative solution. You can purchase, with free shipping, a top name-brand filtration or softener system by shopping at Any installation services listed below can then help with installation, or you can just install the system yourself.</p>
<p>If you experience blockages and backups in your house more than a few times, it's a great idea to have a professional assess your drain system. A drain professional like TLC will use a camera to inspect your drain system. Often, if you have multiple drain problems you might have a drain line break someplace in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can locate and identify the issue so the drain can be fixed.</p>
<p>If your water heater has actually needed numerous repairs over the last few years, it may be time to get it changed. A great guideline for hot water heater is this: since the lifespan of the typical hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET provided by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We advise, as most plumbers do, to use disposals sparingly. Correct care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its guarantee and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
