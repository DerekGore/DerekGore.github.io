Throughout regeneration, salted water from the salt water tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become infected. There is potential for the infected water to end up being a health risk if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, as well as examined yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
