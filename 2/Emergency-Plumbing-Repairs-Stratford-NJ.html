<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual service is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed.

This is an alternative to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous decades, however steel eventually suffers from corrosion and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
