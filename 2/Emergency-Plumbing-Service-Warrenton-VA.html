<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the cause of the problem. The line was clearly deteriorating; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
