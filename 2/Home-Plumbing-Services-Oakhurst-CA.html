<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Most house centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.

<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather condition security. As the outer coating of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Older toilets typically use 3.5 gallons or more per flush, particularly if they were made prior to 1994. Newer models just use 1.6 gallons per flush while still offering the same flushing power. More recent toilet styles are environmentally-friendly and have a double flushing system which just uses 0.9 gallons per flush. Tankless water heaters: These hot water heater heat much faster than traditional water heaters. They also use up less space given that they don't need a tank.</p>
