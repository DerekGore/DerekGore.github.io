<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
