<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, permitting air to restore and enter the valve pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric standard. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
