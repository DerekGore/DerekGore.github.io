<p>When it comes to plumbing and maintenance, sewer video inspection is amongst the best ways to stay ahead of the game. This extensive inspection can discover extreme problems with your sewer line you may not observe till it's far too late. Using this technology, you see a walk-through view of the inner-workings of your pipes, and the Seatown Electric Plumbing Heating and Air group can better decide how to rectify your problems. Our Seattle, WA team is trusted for electrical and HVAC work, so you know our plumbing services will be reliable also.</p>
<p>Many homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the external covering of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>To remove the cable from the old disposer, utilize a screwdriver to eliminate the plate covering the electrical connections at the bottom of the system. Disconnect the wire nuts and pull the cable through the cover plate hole. For preventive maintenance, Larry & Sons uses yearly checkups on your sewer and septic systems. Our service technicians thoroughly examine your entire drainage system with video camera pipe inspection to avoid future problems before they occur. Our yearly maintenance services also include detailed drain cleaning to keep your pipes clear.</p>
