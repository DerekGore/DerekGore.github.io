I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a substantial blockage that required excavation to investigate.
