<p>Concealed water leakages are often stressful and have Possibly Serious Consequences. Changing your flapper might need slightly different steps than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve.

If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>

<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
