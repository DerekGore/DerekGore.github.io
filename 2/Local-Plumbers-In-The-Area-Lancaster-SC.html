<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Lancaster SC</h3>
<p>The most effective method to attend to tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>A new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the within used thin pipe and the painting the within the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Often during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes. Some of those thin spots leak immediately and often those leaks come weeks or days later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be appropriately re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
