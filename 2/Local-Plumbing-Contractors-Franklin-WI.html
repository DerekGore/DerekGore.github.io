They were really professional and did an awesome job. I would certainly call them once again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration only appears when hot water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is obviously still a problem that needs to be dealt with immediately (you'll likely need a brand-new hot water heater) however not one that requires repiping.</p>
