Sodium ions are held loosely and are changed quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, complimentary" sodium ions are released into the water. The time between charging cycles depends on the solidity of the water, the amount of water used, the size of the system and the capability of the exchange media to eliminate solidity.</p>
<p>Responsibility for installation falls upon the owner of the co-op or the property or apartment board. Owners and boards of buildings that are provided an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer must submit plans with the DEP within one month. If the DEP has not received accreditation from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being set up within that time, a Notification of Offense will be sent. Lawbreakers will be responsible for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 provided by the Environmental protection Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can eventually cause criminal and civil actions and procedures, along with the termination of water service to the building.</p>
