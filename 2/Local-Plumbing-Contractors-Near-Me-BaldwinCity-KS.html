<p>The toilet takes a truly very long time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout normal operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves-- referred to as the zone of decreased pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our market and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can achieve this.</p>
