<p>When pipes are organized into a vertical kind it is referred to as a hydrostatic loop. In this configuration the loop need to be greater than 33 feet to operate appropriately. When designed by doing this it prevents siphoning and backflow into a water system. Plumb Crazy Plumbing uses a standard 30 day warranty on repairs, drain cleaning and 1 year guarantee on replacement plumbing tasks.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
