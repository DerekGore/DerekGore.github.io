<p>To identify which toilet valve is triggering the difficulty, look at the overflow tube. If water is overflowing into the tube, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to trickle into the bowl. That slow, consistent outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water stains and corrosion. But do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
