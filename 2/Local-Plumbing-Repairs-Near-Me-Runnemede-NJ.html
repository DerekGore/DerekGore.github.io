<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to service? The timing of regrowth depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of an established schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, regardless of whether the water really requires it. More recent systems utilize electronic sensing units that keep track of bead deficiency and other crucial metrics based upon your water usage and therefore just regrow when needed. These newer systems, also described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal since they save energy and money-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
<p>Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the diminished salt water solution after the regeneration cycle. Secure the drain hose safely and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning drainage, all drain hoses must have an air gap. The end of the hose be at least two inches above the dedicated drain. An air gap might be utilized to accomplish this, and may be needed depending upon local plumbing codes.</p>
