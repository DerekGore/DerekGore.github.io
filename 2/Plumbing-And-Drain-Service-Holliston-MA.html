Expense 41-15 (PDF): The Current Plumbing and Gasfitting Code of Baltimore County was authorized by the County Council on May 4, 2015 with an effective date of July 1, 2015.

<p>To figure out which toilet valve is causing the trouble, look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to trickle into the bowl. That slow, consistent outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing totally. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water spots and deterioration. But don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
