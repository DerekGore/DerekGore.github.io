<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

The factors for this can range from leakages, malfunctioning or defective electrical wiring, or a broken heating element or thermostat. A repair or replacement of the elements might be sufficient if it is one of the discussed concerns. Nevertheless, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems occurring often, then a water heater replacement is necessary.</p>
