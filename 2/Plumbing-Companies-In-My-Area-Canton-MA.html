<p>A brand-new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of worn thin pipe and the painting the inside of the used pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin spots leak immediately and often those leaks come weeks or days later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be correctly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
