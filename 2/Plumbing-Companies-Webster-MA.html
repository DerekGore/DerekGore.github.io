<p>Standard tank-type water heaters consist of steel cylinders that are fed by a water pipe that dips into a large storage tank. The water inside this tank is heated up and after that launched into the pipes of your home through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank includes the temperature level and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you surpass a pre-programmed level. You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperature levels and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
