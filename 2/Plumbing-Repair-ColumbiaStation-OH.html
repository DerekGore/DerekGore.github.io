Sprinkler Warehouse does not advise AVB's for irrigations systems where there is a potential to infect drinking water. AVB's are not testable and it is not possible to discover when one has failed.</p>
<p>Another typical misperception is that calcium-carbonate scale is an effective form of deterioration control. There is an absence of clinical proof supporting this claim, nevertheless. Scale does not form in uniform homogeneous layers that would secure pipe from deterioration Scale can be permeable or soft and is extremely irregular. When hard-water scale is already present, Deterioration can still take place under conditions that are favorable to the development of hard-water scale or even.</p>
