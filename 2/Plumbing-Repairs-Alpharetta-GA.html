<p>Backsiphonage can happen when there is a sudden reduction in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as during fire battling or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This turnaround can create a suction result and draw possible pollutants into the safe and clean (drinking) water supply. Storage tank water heaters are typically discovered in a lot of houses. Their components are an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water up until it's needed.
