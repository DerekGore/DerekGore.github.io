<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had actually backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 efforts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his understanding and experience he determined that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink.

By including perseverence and perseverance the job was done to my total satisfaction.</p>
