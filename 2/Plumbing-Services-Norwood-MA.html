Unseen sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a separate drain path, small pipes range from the tub and sink to eventually meet up with a bigger one beneath the toilet, bring waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the house.</p>
<p>During normal operation, the pressure between the two check valves, described as the zone of decreased pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is designed to discharge and open water to the outside if either check valve ought to leak.

For this factor, the RPZ should be installed in locations that are not subject to water damage and permit adequate drainage.</p>
