<p>You'll observe that water runs to refill the bowl Whenever you flush your toilet. Nevertheless, in a correctly working toilet, the water must stop running as soon as the bowl is filled to its proper capacity. Chances are you have an internal leak and water is being discarded down the overflow if your toilet continues to run. These leaks are exceptionally inefficient, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up traveling through the overflow.</p>
<p>Your disposer might come with a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the standard plumber's putty as detailed below. Both will create an excellent seal (though the gasket may result in percentages of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is mainly a matter of preference. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to get rid of.</p>
