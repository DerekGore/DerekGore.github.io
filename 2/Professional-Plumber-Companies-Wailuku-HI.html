<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
