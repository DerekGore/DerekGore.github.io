During regeneration, salted water from the brine tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>Take the example of the instant hot shower that makes use of the point-of-use water heaters; these appliances will supply hot water constantly for the period you are using the shower. They will stop to work just if there are power concerns or if the water heater is defective. In essence, it heats the water as needed with simply the quantity you need, hence eliminating the loss sustained with using storage tank water heaters where the water cools and is then reheated.</p>
