<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. If enabled to return to the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for effectiveness, in addition to inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
