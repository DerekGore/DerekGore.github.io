<h3>Best Gas Tankless Water Heater - Indoor Vs. Outdoor Installation in Hempstead NY</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon for how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its numerous designated usages around your home.</p>
<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften difficult water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>That's why we at Big Blue Plumbing answer calls day or night to take care of broken water heaters and other plumbing emergency situations. We'll work to repair the issue and assess as efficiently and effectively as possible, getting your hot water heater up and running in no time.
