<p>Gas is a clean-burning and affordable  approach to running appliances and heating homes. There are still some drawbacks, however, as a gas leak can cause damage to your home, lead to health threats and even worse. To properly preserve your gas lines, you need to have them periodically inspected by a licensed plumber to help determine and repair any corrosion and leakage that could be causing hazardous conditions.</p>
<p>Most houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather protection. As the outer covering of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Inspections are required in a lot of states to make sure piping is at the required depth. For instance, California has rigorous policies regarding underground gas line installation due to the fact that of earthquakes and other natural catastrophes. Piping needs to be at least 18 inches listed below ground for much safer locations and 24 inches for areas at higher risk of external damage.</p>
