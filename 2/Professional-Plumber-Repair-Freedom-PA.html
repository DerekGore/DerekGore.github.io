Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To discover a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, however opportunities are you'll locate one of the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
