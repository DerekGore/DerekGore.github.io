I in fact got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
