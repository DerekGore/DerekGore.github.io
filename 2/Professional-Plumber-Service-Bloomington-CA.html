<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Regrettably, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leakages happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these problems.</p>
<p>Blending vaporized salt with rock salt is not recommended, as this might clog the softening tank.
