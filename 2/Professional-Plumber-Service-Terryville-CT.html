<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
