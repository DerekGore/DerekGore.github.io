<p>There are a couple of indicators that will let you know you have a gas line leak in your home, and it is very important to take note of them. The gas pipe might be pierced or harmed if you discover a strong odor that resembles rotten eggs. You may also hear a hissing sound as the gas is escaping from the line, but that isn't always the case. It is essential to take action quickly to avoid any serious problems and to keep everyone safe if you smell rotten eggs.</p>
<p>Your disposer might include a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the conventional plumber's putty as described listed below. Both will produce a good seal (though the gasket might result in percentages of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is mainly a matter of choice. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to eliminate.</p>
