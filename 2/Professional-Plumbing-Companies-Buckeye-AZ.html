<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. There is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health threat if enabled to return to the water supply.
