<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Culpeper VA</h3>
<p>Sealed and correctly working pipes will save you money monthly on your gas costs.

<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
