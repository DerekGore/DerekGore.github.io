<p>We bring the full variety of Backflow prevention options. So which should you use? The plumbers at Clarke & Rush are specialists in repipe jobs, and certified to assist you make this important decision. We will ensure you understand your choices, the benefits and downsides, and make a recommendation so you can make an informed option. A garbage disposal usually plugs into a 120-volt GFCI (ground-fault circuit interruptor) outlet under the sink. If an outlet like this isn't readily available under your sink, you'll have to have an electrician install one.</p>
<p>The customer has one month to finish installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (check the due date on Notice of Requirements form). The majority of the time, a professional plumber can come out and discover the issue and make the repairs. In some instances, the toilet might be too old, and replacement parts are not offered, so a replacement toilet is needed.</p>
<p>Water softeners been available in all sizes and shapes and bigger certainly does not mean much better.
