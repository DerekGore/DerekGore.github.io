An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a new pipe. This makes building projects quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
