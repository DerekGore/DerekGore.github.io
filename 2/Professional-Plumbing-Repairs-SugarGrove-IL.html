<p>Many vehicles have a metal line that runs the length of the car with rubber fuel lines linking at either end, one at the fuel tank and the other to the engine. Fixing a leaking fuel line is an easy task for a repair center and expenses between $60 and $120. Lavacot states it can easily be done in the house by the semi-advanced mechanic. Tough water causes gray or white deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be used to lower these signs.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply.

Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
