There are two main kinds of backflow preventers, and each has its own maintenance requirements. Double check valve assembly (DCV) and reduced pressure zone assembly (RPZ) devices are most commonly utilized in commercial centers.</p>

<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, however how do they work and which designs are best for specific applications? Often the type and installation requirements are defined by local statutes and environmental regulations. Local building codes for example will require a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air space between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any prospective siphon before it can occur, preventing infecting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more complex and sophisticated backflow preventers.
