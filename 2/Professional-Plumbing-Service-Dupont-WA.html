<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
