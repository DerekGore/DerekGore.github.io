<p>Put your trust in a drain cleaning service technician with over 45 years of experience in drain cleaning services. These specialists will guarantee your drains are totally clog-free once they're done. While a high quality, high horsepower disposal can grind and push practically anything down the kitchen sink, it doesn't mean it's good for the pipes. Gas shut-off valve installation expenses between $52 and $138 per device, consisting of labor and products. Materials cost $15 to $50 per valve, while labor runs $45 to $150 per hour. A shut-off valve is needed to shut down the gas to the home whenever a device requires repair or for emergency situations.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend far more. With this method, you know the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
