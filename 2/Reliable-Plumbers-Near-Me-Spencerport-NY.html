Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
