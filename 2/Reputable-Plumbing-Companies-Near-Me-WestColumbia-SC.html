Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

After we have cleaned up the body, and the fixed parts are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be challenging, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is very important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be utilized to guarantee the line is appropriately flushed.</p>
