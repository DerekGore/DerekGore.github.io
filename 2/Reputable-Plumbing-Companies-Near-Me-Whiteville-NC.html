<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>Even if you think you can manage it on your own, you probably don't have a camera suitable for detecting the cause of blockage around bends in your pipes. You may even have a drain snake handy, but when's the last time you used it-- and are you sure you're doing it right? Often the very best thing you can do for your home is call someone with the right tools and knowledge to fix your problem quickly and effectively. For Tewksbury, Andover, Billerica, and nearby communities, Gregory Ostroski Plumbing and Heating is often the first company individuals call for a drain cleaning service that works and is simple on their pipes.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was clearly deteriorating; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
