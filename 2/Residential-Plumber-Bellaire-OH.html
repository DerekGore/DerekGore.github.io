Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A lot of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the appropriate precautions if using one of these items.</p>

The camera can recognize the problem and find so the drain can be fixed.</p>
