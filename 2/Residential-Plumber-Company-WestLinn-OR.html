Call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700 if sewage from the City-maintained portion of the sewer system backs up through toilets or sinks. City workers will check and get rid of obstructions in the mainline sewer and the part of the service line that the City is responsible for.

Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to eliminate.</p>
