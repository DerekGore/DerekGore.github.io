<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive product. Some disposer systems do not come with a power cord connected. Remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1) if this is the case. Make sure to acquire an electrical wiring set with the proper power ranking and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). Make sure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cord when you connect the wiring harness to the disposer.</p>

<p>New houses constructed with copper pipes are especially vulnerable to destructive water conditions because the copper pipes have not had a chance to end up being coated inside. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a duration of 3 to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new homes are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
