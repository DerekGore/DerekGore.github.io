<p>The next step we need to carry out in the repair procedure, is to flush the incoming water line. After we have actually cleaned the body, and the repaired elements are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or particles. This can be challenging, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be utilized to assure the line is properly flushed.</p>
