Worms for watering systems: Residents found parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the air pressure breaker malfunctioned on an independently owned underground lawn sprinkler.

<p>Aside from these 2 crucial elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less vital things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom.

<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
