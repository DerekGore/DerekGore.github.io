<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, allowing air to enter the valve and restore pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
