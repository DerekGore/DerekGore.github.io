<h3>Kitchen Sink Leaking in Lakeport California</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
