<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation direction within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of regular flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, however how do they work and which styles are best for particular applications? Often the type and installation requirements are spelled out by ecological policies and local statutes. Local building regulations for example will need a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air gap in between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any potential siphon prior to it can happen, preventing infecting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more advanced and complex backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical gadgets set up to prevent backflow range from the relatively simple to the complicated and really sophisticated.</p>
