<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the extent of the rot.

Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
