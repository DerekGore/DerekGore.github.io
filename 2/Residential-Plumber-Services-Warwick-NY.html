<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
