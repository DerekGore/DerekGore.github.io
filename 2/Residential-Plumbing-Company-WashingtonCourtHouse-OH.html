<p>The most convenient method to keep you and your family safe from the prospective threats of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the very first place. Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, pool, water feature or other type of cross connection, have actually an approved backflow prevention assembly installed.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can acquire designs with unique features that do whatever but include the salt, you will pay for each extra function. The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm assurance that the unique function will not fail. Depending on the water source, you might need to filter turbid water or sanitize bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening system. Lastly, if you own a septic system, you need to consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates show that about 50 gallons of water are utilized for each regrowth cycle. This might or may not trigger hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth instantly begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regeneration generally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
