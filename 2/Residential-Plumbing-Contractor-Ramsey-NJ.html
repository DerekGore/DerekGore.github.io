<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the glory in the toilet world, however the trip lever is the bridge in between guy and machine. After all, if the trip lever does not lift the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to wiggle and jerk and in some cases even stick your hand in there and raise the flapper manually. And who wants to do all that work???
