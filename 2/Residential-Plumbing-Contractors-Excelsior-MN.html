<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>Water heater diagnostics: We determine what is wrong with your hot water heater, in addition to what maintenance work requires to be performed moving forward.
