<h3>Unclog Drains, Toilets and Sewers With The Help of Plumbers in CouncilBluffs IA</h3>
<p>Our group is prepared to handle your plumbing concern. From regular service to complicated setups, our mission is to surpass your expectations. An authorization and inspections are required for the majority of residential jobs including porches, additions, and equipment such as a/c unit and water heaters. A plan might be needed to obtain the authorization if new work is carried out such as replacement of gas piping.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
