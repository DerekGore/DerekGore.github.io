<p>Water softeners leaks are mostly triggered since of a concern at the point of installation or due to the fact that of maintenance. When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated effectively. It can also cause the system to leak if the bypass valve is cracked. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced over time.
