<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
