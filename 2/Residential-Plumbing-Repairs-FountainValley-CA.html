Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
