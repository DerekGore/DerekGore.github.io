Your kitchen might become clogged by food or grease, while in the bathroom it might be hair or pieces of soap that cause the clog. Your toilet may become stopped due to excess paper being flushed, or you might have a house-wide backup brought on by sewage returning up through the pipes.</p>
<p>To make positioning a toilet simpler, new toilet bolts are extra long. That implies you have to cut off the protruding ends later with a hacksaw. However first link the water line, flush the toilet a number of times and look for leakages. Leaving the bolts uncut till you've done these final checks lets you quickly remove and reset the toilet if you discover any problems.</p>
