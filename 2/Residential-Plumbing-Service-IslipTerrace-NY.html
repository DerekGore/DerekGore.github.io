<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back against the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. If permitted to return to the water supply, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for effectiveness, as well as inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
