<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the best is common in our market and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
