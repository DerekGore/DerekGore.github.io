<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures unusable. Whether you have a sink that does not drain effectively or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help. In some cases drain repair needs can be resolved reasonably quickly by a skilled handyman. At other times, however, portions of a drain may need to be dismantled, taken a look at, and cleared prior to being changed. In many cases, a handyman may determine that a replacement part is necessary (like a pvc, reducer, or tailpiece trap) to ensure typical operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman agent today to talk about repair choices.</p>
