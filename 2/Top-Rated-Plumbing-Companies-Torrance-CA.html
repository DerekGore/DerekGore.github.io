<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system must be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed.
