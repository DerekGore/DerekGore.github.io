The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems includes the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves.

As structure types and contents of these structures can be really different, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation requires to be designed and set up to meet that particular hazard or need.
