<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water.

Considering that opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched.
